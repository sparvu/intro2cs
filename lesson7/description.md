# System Performance Analysis

* Non functional testing. What does it mean?
* Tactical planning. Plan and get ready for a possible disaster.
* Software scalability. What does it mean?
* Why performance analysis is hard?
* Throughput. Latency. Utilization.
* Performance data. Performance Models. (You need to compare measured, empirical data with a model to check data consistency, to explain the trends and get more insights) 
* High utilization. Underutilized. Adding more hardware at it does not always fix the problem(s)
* All measurements come with errors. Determine and track the magnitude of the errors in your performance data
* Little's Law
* Homework
