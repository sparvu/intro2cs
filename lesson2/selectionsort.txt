    # we advance the position through the entire array
    for i from 0 to n -1
     
        ### assume the min is the first element 
        jMin = i
        
        ### Find the index of the minimum element in the unsorted part
        for j from i + 1 to n 
            if A[j] < A[jMin] then

        if (jMin != i) then
            swap A[i] with A[jMin]
    
    # Array is now sorted
